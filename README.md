## ‚≠ê E-Commerce Ratings & Reviews Service
For this project, my team was tasked with replacing the API for an e-commerce clothing retailer in order to handle increased web traffic. Each teammate focused on a different microservice. I worked on the Ratings & Reviews service.

## üèÜ Achievements and Optimizations
- Seeded a PostgreSQL database with over 10 million records
- Optimized raw SQL query execution times to average < 1ms per query using hash indexes, joins and PostgreSQL JSON functions
- Improved throughput from around 200 requests per second to 5000 requests per second with <20 ms latency and 0% error rate on average by horizontal scaling with a NGINX and load-balancing between two servers
- Deployed database and each server using Docker containers for version control
